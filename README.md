## Repository structure

- `scripts/`  
  R scripts for data import, quality control, visualisation, and differential expression analysis.  
  Scripts are numbered and should be run in order.

- `results/`  
  Final figures generated by the analysis scripts and included in the report.

- `data/`  
  Placeholder directory for input data (raw and intermediate data files are not stored here).

## Input Data 
Input data is in the form of one directory containing Salmon counts.
The `counts/` directory should be downloaded to the R working directory and unzipped to allow import into R.
The count data can be downloaded from the link: https://github.com/sjcockell/mmb8052/raw/main/practicals/practical_08/results/counts.zip


## To reproduce the analysis:
Once count data has been downloaded, the scripts should be ran in order to generate the results and figures included in the lab report.
